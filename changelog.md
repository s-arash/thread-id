# v4.2.1

Released 2023-10-16.

 * Remove Redox-specific dependencies in favor of the `libc` crate, in
   accordance [with Redox' ABI stability plans][redox-abi]. This makes Redox
   use the same pthreads calls as the other Unix-like platforms. ([#15][15])
 * Ensures compatibility with Rust 1.34.2 through 1.73.0.

Thanks to 4lDO2 for contributing to this release.

# v3.1.0

Released 2017-05-13.

 * Add the MIT license as an alternative to the Apache 2.0 license. This license
   change applies retroactively to all versions, this is only a metadata change.

# v3.0.0

Released 2016-10-29.

 * Depend on libc only on Unix-like environments, and on kernel32-sys only
   on Windows. This requires Rust 1.8 or later, hence the major version
   bump.
